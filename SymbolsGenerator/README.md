# SymbolEnumCreator

This command line tool creates most of the `SFSafeSymbols` code by converting the input files to Swift code.

The tool is best used by opening a terminal, changing to the main `SFSafeSymbols` directory and running `make generate-symbol`. The relevant files are then (over)written automatically. Newly created files must be added manually to the `SFSafeSymbols` Xcode project.
